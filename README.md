BarTab Unflash
==============

This is an extension for Firefox written using the [JetPack
SDK](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com).  It automatically unloads tabs
containing a Flash plugin as soon as you leave them.  For that it uses
the unload mechanism from the
[BarTab](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/67651) extension for
Firefox which has to be installed for this extension to work.
